PROFILE          I am an Engineer who has a passion for technology. I have been working as  a developer, manager, and educator for the past 8 years.
                          My main introduction to software came when my family got the internet in 1994.  I was fascinated by the web and began using HTML, CSS, and JS to create sites. I then learned more about databases  and js frameworks in courses and my own studies. In college I took courses in Algorithm Design and Analysis, Program Design, and Logic.

EXPERIENCE
  
Netclearly
  PHP / Wordpress  Developer
  May 2019 – June 2019 
                                  
                          I was brought on to Netclearly as a contractor to increase the performance of a PHP/Wordpress website. I significantly decreased the site's FTTB, download size, and render time. I removed unused plugins  and wrote custom PHP functions to reduce the number of calls  to the backend. Additionally I helped refactor, compress, and minify the css displayed on several pages. During this project I worked with Linux, Gitlab, Wordpress, Google Lighthouse, Docker, and Ngnix. Finally, I worked on the information architecture of their item database to optimize SQL queries and plan for a future NoSQL database.
  

   Tibco Software Inc.
  UX  Developer
  October 2014 – August 2018
  
                          I was brought on to Tibco as a contractor for a project named API Exchange. I built a restful API using PHP, Apache, Swagger UI, and Joomla plugins. Afterwards, I was responsible for the front end using JS, AJAX, Jquery, HTML, CSS and, MVC for the presentation layer PHP, Joomla, and MYSQL for the back end. I worked on the project for  around two years and eventually lead a team of four developers. My team and I worked to allow XML/WSDL importing for customers to                         define their web services. The domain of the project was API management.
  In August 2015, Tibco acquired Mashery. I was brought on to be a knowledge sponge and help with the integration since Mashery was also an API management product. The front end technology was Backbone JS, Handlebars, Gulp, HTML, Less, and D3.
  I was responsible for an entire CSS Rebranding and Refactoring. I found the front end architecture heavily component based with good separation of concerns. I also worked on unit testing in Mocha and Chai; Git hooks to run linting on commit. For the Mashery back end, I worked on refining the inputs and outputs for the PHP APIs and adding database tables for new feature work. I also worked on Docker optimization for the local development stack, CLI, Puppet, and Vagrant. 
Around October 2016, I began working on a Tibco internal Learning and Development site. I was given a lead role to choose technologies and to turn client requests into requirements. The client expressed an interest in Google Sites, so I looked into that. Eventually, I settled on a  JS, HTML, CSS, and React front end and a NodeJS Google Docs back end that was hosted on Heroku. 
For Clarity, I worked only on the front end. I used JS, React, LESS and Jquery. Clarity is used for data cleaning and transforming. Like Mashery, my team and I updated Clarity so that it would fit in with the Tibco Pattern Library and other cloud suite products.

Business Connect is a B2B project. At the start, I was working with their legacy system to create a dashboard page using Tibco Spotfire. That used HTML, JSP, and JS for the front end. After a few months, we 
decided on a rebuild and that was written using  Angular4 and Redux. I worked on Business Connect and Clarity concurrently.
The Tibco department I worked in was the UX team, but we also had the name of Innovation Labs. As such, I was exposed in a few ways to new and interesting technologies. I was in charge of development interns for several years, so I got to teach and participate in many great student projects. We also had brown-bag lunches where experts in their field including myself would come and talk or give a hands-on meeting. I  worked on IOT, IOT swarm, Computer Vision, Python, Rasbian, and General Input Output within these projects.
  Digital Media Academy 
  Instructional Staff
  June 2014 – August 2014
I led six programs at  Berkeley, Stanford and Aspen teaching OOP principles  in JAVA to classes of 25 12-16 y/o students. I created curriculum and then taught the basics  of the Eclipse editor, Maven, Debugging and OOP principles. 
                          Mangalam Research Center
  Web Developer / Business Process Architect
  Dec. 2011 – June 2014

                          Created automated workflow and business process automation for user acquisition, information storage, networking, and integration.  I created and managed websites using Joomla 2.5, 3, 3.3, WordPress, Drupal, HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and CSS. Also, I worked with the Adobe Suite using Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop to design brochures, flyers, postcards, inserts, bookmarks, and newsletters for both commercial printing and web display. Additionally,  I used Salesforce connectors  to allow automated database inserts from the current spreadsheets available. Lastly, I researched using XSL to transform older book XML formats into more modern machine readable data.
